    "text": "I've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.\n\nFor anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).\n\nThere is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!",

    "text": "Family diner. Had the buffet. Eclectic assortment: a large chicken leg, fried jalape\u00f1o, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, fresh melon. All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations. Next to the Clarion Hotel.",

Does your dick reach your ass? Yes? Go fuck yourself! I'm a frequent customer AND great tipper. Glad that Kanella just opened. NEVER going back to dmitris!",

    "text": "My experience with Shalimar was nothing but wonderful. \nI wanted to get my engagement ring sized and was told over the phone that it could probably be done within the day. \nWhen I brought it by, the team confirmed that the jeweler would be able to accommodate my same-day request and that it would be around $40 (simple band, decrease by three full sizes).\nI checked my size one more time, confirmed, and left to let them do their thing.\nWhen I came to pick up later that afternoon, the ring was too small. It's very important to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly, but that I made a mistake and should've gone up a half-size.\nThe Shalimar group were completely understanding and accommodating, even resizing my ring back up and getting it back to me within an hour at no charge! Even though it was my mistake!\nThe associates' attitudes in dealing with what was a pretty embarrassing situation instantly earned my satisfaction and loyalty as a customer. Very grateful for such a wonderful experience.",

    "text": "The bun makes the Sonoran Dog. It's like a snuggie for the pup. A first, it seems ridiculous and almost like it's going to be too much, exactly like everyone's favorite blanket with sleeves. Too much softness, too much smush, too indulgent.  Wrong. It's warm, soft, chewy, fragrant, and it succeeds where other famed Sonoran Dogs fail. \n\nThe hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions. \n\nI'm with the masses on the carne asada caramelo. Excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne. \n\nSuper cheap and you can drive through.",
